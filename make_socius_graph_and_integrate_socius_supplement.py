# KEY INSIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE HOVERTEXT WITH ADDITIONAL FIELDS
# per stack overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59057881/python-plotly-how-to-customize-hover-template-on-with-what-information-to-show
###             For Plotly Express, you need to use the custom_data argument when you create the figure. For example:
###
###         fig = px.scatter(
###             data_frame=df,
###             x='ColX',
###             y='ColY',
###             custom_data=['Col1', 'Col2', 'Col3']
###         )
###         and then modify it using update_traces and hovertemplate, referencing it as customdata. For example:
###
###         fig.update_traces(
###             hovertemplate="<br>".join([
###                 "ColX: %{x}",
###                 "ColY: %{y}",
###                 "Col1: %{customdata[0]}",
###                 "Col2: %{customdata[1]}",
###                 "Col3: %{customdata[2]}",
###             ])
###         )
# Plotly express uses the custom_data parameter while  graph objects uses a customdata parameter that captures 
# the same idea, but requires that the input be run thought numpy and list

# check a blended, but mostly 2 year military school that is tiny on the graph
